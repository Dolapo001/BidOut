This is an online auction web application built using Django, allowing users to create, view, and bid on auction listings. The application features models for User, Listing, Bid, and Comment. Users can create listings with a title, description, starting bid, and optional image URL and category. The default route displays all active listings with relevant details. Clicking on a listing leads to a dedicated page showing all listing information, including the current price.
Signed-in users can add listings to their watchlist and place bids on items. The auction creator can close the auction, determining the winner. Users can also leave comments on listing pages. The Watchlist page displays all listings added to a user's watchlist, and users can view active listings by category. Site administrators can manage listings, comments, and bids through the Django admin interface.
